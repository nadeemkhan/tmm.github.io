Today, I turned 25.

I definitely feel another year older. Sometimes—most years in fact—I feel the same. But this year, I definitely *feel* older. I accomplished, and did a lot, during 24. I moved cities and jobs, said goodbye to people I love, and spent a ton of time on airplanes. Maybe that's why?

Whatever the case, I'm tremendously excited for 25.

Even though I'm only hours into a quarter century, I can't help thinking that I need to move faster already. There's so much I want to do, and 25 seems like the year to do it.

People love picking words or phrases to label time periods: Renaissance, Industrial Revolution, etc. I'm often opposed to this as it generalizes way too much. But for 25, what the heck. Might as well.

*Focus*

Twenty-five will be a year of focus for me: A year to be more intentional about what I spend time on and who I spend time with.

I won't be stingy with my time. But I will protect it from things I [don't want to do](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html). What do I want to do? More of the same things that give me joy: building tech products that people want, writing for myself and for others, meeting new people in this awesome (still-newish-to-me) city, and giving my time to those I love so they can help me spend it.
